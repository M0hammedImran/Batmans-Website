            <h1>Bruce Wayne</h1>
            <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed
                the murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the
                Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his
                personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly
                living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. He
                supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a
                celebrity socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which
                encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities
                as Batman account for most of his time</p>

            <h1>Adversaries</h1>
            <p>Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them
                mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead
                them to a life of crime. These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Batman_family_enemies#Classic_rogues_gallery"
                    target="_blank">rogues
                    gallery</a>. Batman's "most
                implacable foe" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered
                by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and
                appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and
                resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents
                "everything Batman [opposes]". Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery
                include Catwoman (a cat burglar antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the
                Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane,
                Clayface, and Killer Croc among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at
                Arkham Asylum.</p>

                <p>Batman's butler, Alfred Pennyworth serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few

                    very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident
                    of
                    Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character lends a homely touch to Batman's environs and ever ready
                    to
                    provide a steadying and reassuring hand to the hero and his sidekick.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League" target="_blank">2. Justice League</a></h3><br>
            <p>Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders.
                Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the
                co-stars of World's Finest and Superman/Batman series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as
                close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship,
                with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. Superman observes, "Sometimes,
                I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he
                reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."

            <p>

                Robin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years.
                Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it
                got a little tiresome always having him thinking." The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in
                1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero Nightwing. A second
                Robin, Jason Todd, appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed
                in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the Red Hood,
                and became an antihero vigilante with no qualms about using firearms or deadly force. Carrie Kelley, the
                first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's
                graphic novels The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, fighting alongside an aging
                Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.</p><br>
            <p>
                The third Robin in mainstream comics is Tim Drake, who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his
                own comic series, and currently goes by Red Robin, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the
                first decade of the new millennium, Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in-universe Robin between
                stints as her self-made vigilante identity The Spoiler, and later as Batgirl. After Stephanie Brown's
                apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to Damian Wayne,
                the ten-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, in the late 2000s. Damian's tenure as du jour
                Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of Batman Incorporated in 2013. Batman's next
                young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the
                ornithological theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of Bluebird in 2014. Unlike the
                Robins, Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun, albeit non-lethal; her weapon of choice is a
                modified rifle that fires taser rounds. In 2015, a new series began titled We Are Robin, focused on a
                group of teenagers using the Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City.</p>
