            <h1>Bruce Wayne</h1>
            <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed
                the murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the
                Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his
                personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly
                living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. He
                supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a
                celebrity socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which
                encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities
                as Batman account for most of his time</p>

            <h1>Adversaries</h1>
            <p>Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them
                mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead
                them to a life of crime. These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Batman_family_enemies#Classic_rogues_gallery">rogues
                    gallery</a>. Batman's "most
                implacable foe" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered
                by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and
                appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and
                resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents
                "everything Batman [opposes]". Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery
                include Catwoman (a cat burglar antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the
                Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane,
                Clayface, and Killer Croc among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at
                Arkham Asylum.</p>
