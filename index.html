            <h1>Bruce Wayne</h1>
            <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed
                the murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the
                Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his
                personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly
                living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. He
                supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a
                celebrity socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which
                encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities
                as Batman account for most of his time</p>
